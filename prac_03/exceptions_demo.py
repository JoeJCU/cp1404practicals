CP1404/CP5632 - Practical
Answer the following questions:
1. When will a ValueError occur?
2. When will a ZeroDivisionError occur?
3. Could you change the code to avoid the possibility of a ZeroDivisionError?

try:
    numerator = int(input("Enter the numerator: "))
    denominator = int(input("Enter the denominator: "))
    fraction = numerator / denominator
    print(fraction)

except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
print("Finished.")


#1: A value error will pop up when the user enters a string rather than an int
#2: when the denominator is 0
#3: Yes and no. You can't divide by 0 what code can be added to maybe change input '0' to '1' for example.
